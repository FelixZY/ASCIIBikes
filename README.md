# ASCIIBikes

A 2d remake of the tron style game [Armagetron Advanced](https://www.armagetronad.org/) for the linux terminal.

This game was originally created as part of the university course TDDC77 Object oriented programming at Link√∂ping
University in 2016. I'm backing it up to keep as a memory.

Note: I don't think this was the final version of the code - there should have been some player select, a game over
screen etc. as well I think. However, this is the most recent version I've been able to find.
